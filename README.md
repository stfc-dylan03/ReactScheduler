<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repo was created to house a mock up of the scheduler made in Next.js (a React framework) using Typescript.

This was created as part of the RSS try it out day, where we take a day away from normal work to trial and test new technologies that could be beneficial to the team/division now or in the future.

Currently each commit highlights a new feature added and shows how to do something. This is subject to change in the future.

## Findings

### Hot Reload

Hot reload is a feature where the web page updates instantly when a change is made to the code without requiring a full refresh/rebuild. It allows code to change whilst the app is still running.

This allows for much faster development which is extremely beneficial.
